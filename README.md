# Python Bookbot

### BookBot is my first git project!

Well not really...but the message above was part of the challenge, so I kept it! :)

This is the Python Bookbot! The Bookbot will take any book or group of text and count the total occurrences of each letter and present a report sorted from most found to least found. This project was created as part of the Boot.Dev curriculum after learning Python basics. I feel that where I am currently in my Python learning, this was a good balance of challenging and being able to apply what I've learned so far. I had to look a few things up but for the most part I was able to get to the end!
